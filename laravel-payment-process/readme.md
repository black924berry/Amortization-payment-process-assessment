# Laravel Payment Processing
## Database table's structure based on the requirement.

  ### 1. Project Table:

  - id: integer (primary key)
  - name: string
  - wallet_id: integer (foreign key referencing Wallets table)
  - promoter_id: integer (foreign key referencing Promoters table)
  - created_at: timestamp
  - updated_at: timestamp

  ### 2. Amortizations Table:

  - id: integer (primary key)
  - schedule_date: date
  - state: string
  - amount: decimal
  - project_id: integer (foreign key referencing Projects table)
  - created_at: timestamp
  - updated_at: timestamp

  ### 3. Payments Table:

  - id: integer (primary key)
  - amortization_id: integer (foreign key referencing Amortizations table)
  - amount: decimal
  - profile_id: integer (foreign key referencing Profiles table)
  - state: string
  - created_at: timestamp
  - updated_at: timestamp

  ### 4. Wallets Table:

  - id: integer (primary key)
  - balance: decimal
  - created_at: timestamp
  - updated_at: timestamp
  
  ### 5. Promoters Table:

  - id: integer (primary key)
  - name: string
  - email: string
  - created_at: timestamp
  - updated_at: timestamp
  
  ### 6. Profiles Table:

  - id: integer (primary key)
  - name: string
  - email: string
  - created_at: timestamp
  - updated_at: timestamp


## Laravel Code Implementation for payment processing

### 1. Database Migration:
- Create the necessary migration files for each table (projects, amortizations, payments, wallets, promoters, and profiles).
- Define the columns, indexes, and foreign key constraints in the migration files.
- Run the migrations to create the tables in the database.
### 2. Eloquent Models:
- Create the corresponding Eloquent models for each table (Project, Amortization, Payment, Wallet, Promoter, and Profile).
- Define the relationships between the models in their respective classes. (Defined in `Models.php`)
- Define the relationships for the other models (Amortization, Payment, Wallet, Promoter, and Profile) as required.

### 3. Laravel Function to Process Payments:
- Create a Laravel function in a relevant service class that accepts a date as a parameter(defined in `Index.php`).

### 4. Sending Emails:

- In the above, the function `sendDelayedPaymentEmails` is responsible for sending the delayed payment notification email to the project promoter and profiles.
- Need to create an appropriate mail template (`DelayedPaymentEmail`) and configure Laravel to use an email service provider.
### 5. Additional Considerations:
- Implement proper error handling, logging, and exception handling in the Laravel function.
- Optimize the query performance by using eager loading (`with`) and indexing the relevant columns.
- Consider chunking the processing if the dataset is significantly large.
- Need to test the implementation with different scenarios to ensure correctness and efficiency.
